- accounting period management
- chart of accounts management
- vendor management
- reporting and future posting workflows

## Local setup

From the project root, run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r apps/requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## Development notes

- Keep business logic inside the relevant app package under apps/.
- Add or update tests in each app's tests.py file when changing behavior.
- Use environment variables for secrets and configuration in a real deployment setup.

## Next steps

The project currently has the main folder structure and starter modules. The next improvements may include:
- completing app models and serializers
- implementing API endpoints and authentication
- adding documentation for each module
- expanding reporting and posting workflows
